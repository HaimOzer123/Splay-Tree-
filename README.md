# Splay Tree Overview

A **Splay Tree** is a self-adjusting binary search tree that optimizes access to frequently used elements by moving them closer to the root through rotations. 
This results in efficient operations with an amortized time complexity of O(log n).

## Summary
- **Efficient Access:** Moves frequently accessed elements closer to the root.
- **Operations:** Search, insert, delete with O(log n) amortized time.
- **Ideal For:** Scenarios where certain elements are accessed more often.
